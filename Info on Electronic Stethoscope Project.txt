---Overview---------------------------------------------------------------------

    https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/252-bluetooth-stethoscope-pulse-oximeter

Scope:
    We're looking for a functional stethoscope that a doctor can use to listen
    to a patient's vitals, while wearing full protective gear.  A stethoscope on
    a hose is clumsy, not helpful with protective gear (facemask, hooded garment);
    additionally its ackward to disinfect a stethoscope between patients.  An ideal
    solution would be a device that could be wrapped in a disposable covering (perhaps
    a rubber glove?) between patients.

---stupid dumb question for team - Stereo ?-------------------------------------

    LBC note: I was looking at the spec sheet for the AdaFruit MEMS microphone.
    You can use two for stereo.  Wow.  We each have two ears.  Is there any advantage
    to the quality of stethoscope use by providing true stereo performance?
    Perhaps an oval shaped cone? That would increase power usage, but it might
    be a big improvement in the quality of the device's output (?)

    I only have one microphone chip, a AdaFruit Mems development board (I2S)
    I'm going to check my buddies stock & steal (er, borrow) what he has available.
    He thinks he may have some electret condenser microphone elements available.
    I'm pretty sure he has a huge quantity of resistors and capacitors for most needs.

---Listening to heart rate---------------------------------------------------------

    https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/best-microphone-to-detect-heartbeat.155369/

    oops.  Heart rate isn't our primary objective.. its listening to a patient's
    lungs.

    Mike Vang's comment:
        Some of the boards out there like the MAX30100 can serve dual purpose such as
        getting SpO2 measurement and heart rate sensor.

        Including heart rate measurement is a feature that could always be adding if
        using something like a MAX30100 board.

---what about listening to lungs?-----------------------------------------------

    Electret vs mems?
    https://forum.digikey.com/t/electret-condenser-ecm-vs-mems-microphone/447
    Electret condenser microphone (ECM microphone) apply the principle of capacitor
    charge/discharge for operation. The diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor,
    the vibration is generated due to the sound, then produce the changes of
    charge between the plates to make the signal transmission.

    Since the vibration is purely an electromechanical mechanism, it has the
    whole acoustic frequency response (0-20kHZ) and low distortion in the signal
    transmission, generally used in external portable microphone. Its shortcoming
    is being unable to undertake a re-flow soldering, so there is a specific
    soldering process and tools for manual soldering.

    While executing WiFi.scanNetworks() function very first time, module consumes
    average current of 0.5A for 10 ms with four peaks of approx. 0.7A during that

    The spikes have duration of 0.5 ms and appear in bursts with spike rate of 100 ms.

    Apparently it is about 2 times worse than promised in the ESP-32 data sheet.
    I expected to see about 0.3A max (50 mA for CPU and 240 mA max for WiFi

    Can ESP32 handle I2S?  Can it perform A to D?
    https://demo-dijiudu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/peripherals/i2s.html
    ESP32 contains two I2S peripherals. These peripherals can be configured to
    input and output sample data via the I2S driver.  The I2S peripheral supports
    DMA meaning it can stream sample data without requiring each sample to be
    read or written by the CPU.  I2S output can also be routed directly to the
    Digital/Analog Converter output channels (GPIO 25 & GPIO 26) to produce
    analog output directly, rather than via an external I2S codec.

    WebBlueTooth will manage a decent audio stream.  too much data.

    Never mind that this discussion was for the remote Telemedicine out of scope
    proposal.   A doctor needs to use a stethoscope to manage tube insertions to
    a patient right in from of them.  this is not a telemedicine conversation.

---Blood Oxygen level measurement?----------------------------------------------

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry

    Reflective Mode:

    These are good articles/papers about reflective-mode oximetry:
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405959516301205
    https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042413-160152/unrestricted/Final_MQP_Report.pdf

    I don't see any currently available commercial reflective-mode solutions though.
    This article:  https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81961664.pdf  (page 2) shows a prototype reflective-mode circuit.  This has a
     microcontroller but otherwise doesn't look very complicated, we could possibly prototype one.

    Transmissive Mode:

    Apparently fingertip-or-earlobe oximetry is "transmissive mode" oximetry.  "Reflective mode" oximetry is possible at the
    wrists, chest or other sites, so this could theoretically be integrated into a stethoscope puck. The hardware is likely different
    than current market solutions, more research is necessary.

     If transmissive mode (fingertip) sensors would work, it's cheaper to source battery-operated units, one per patient.
     They look difficult to sterilize though.

    I found this Maxim Max30100 pulse oximiter/heartrate module and a review:
      https://www.teachmemicro.com/max30100-arduino-heart-rate-sensor/

    There are a couple different board versions, one is cheaper but harder to work with.
    The more expensive one is about $6/unit on Alibaba, don't know about availability.

    Mike Vang's comment:
        One could combine an electronic stethoscope with an oximeter.

        The paper that is shared below says that a reflectory pulse oximeter has more
        diverse locations it could take like from the feet, head, chest and wrist.
        Accuracy becomes an issue though.

        Reflectory pulse oximeter's has two LED's on one side (red and infrared). I
        think that many pulse oximeter like the Max30100 is a reflectory pulse
        oximeter.

        But we run into an issue: the base that touches the client is enlarged to
        include both a stethoscope and a pulse oximeter.

---High Tech Question-----------------------------------------------------------

    Once you've gone digital, are there other tools we're interested in?
    e.g. Digital Signal Processing including filtering, Frequency domain analysis?

    LBC Note: I've recently finished the Coursera class (Mar 2018)--
    Audio Signal Processing For Music Applications
    https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing
    https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ymusic0001-audio-signal-processing-music-applications

    Meghana... the code work was all done in Python!

    At the time I wanted to use raspberry pi microphone for an interactive dynamic
    outdoor art project in downtown Las Vegas.  I also got bashed hard at a
    hackathon for a mining project, using a microphone / pi system to monitor
    pending mineshaft pump failures.  Great idea, i didn't really understand the
    nuances of Fast Fourier Transforms for live monitoring.  The class was
    really good at forcing you to understand what's going on.

---BlueTooth Linkup-------------------------------------------------------------

    The topic started as a conversation with my research scientist buddy Dirk,
    do we really need a visible screen?  And it gets down to how do you pair
    a digital stethoscope with a Bluetooth headset, if neither of them has a
    visible screen.  What if you are in a location that has lots of other
    Bluetooth devices present?

    One way is to lock the devices together using a dedicated "mac" address.
    You can permanently link the headset to a particular Bluetooth stethoscope.
    Easy to do when you are just making one set, not so easy to do when you need
    fifty or a 1000 of these.  And then if permanently paired, what happens
    when there is a problem with either (expensive) device?  You have to throw
    both pieces away.

    I think that means a OLED display screen is required, to manage the Bluetooth
    pairing process, sigh.  And momentary buttons for up / down / select.

    google search terms: analyse different microphone performance using spectrogram

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram
    A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a
    signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms
    are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data
    is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.

---Stethoscope Design Information-----------------------------------------------

    How does a stethoscope work?
    https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-stethoscope/ (kids basic info)

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stethoscope
    oops. --> Rappaport and Sprague designed a new stethoscope in the 1940s, which
    became the standard by which other stethoscopes are measured, consisting of
    two sides, one of which is used for the respiratory system, the other for the
    cardiovascular system  (LBC note, which bell is for which?)

    And this -->  The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is
    achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from
    ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor. Another method, used
    in Welch-Allyn's Meditron stethoscope, comprises placement of a piezoelectric
    crystal at the head of a metal shaft, the bottom of the shaft making contact
    with a diaphragm. 3M also uses a piezo-electric crystal placed within foam
    behind a thick rubber-like diaphragm. The Thinklabs' Rhythm 32 uses an
    electromagnetic diaphragm with a conductive inner surface to form a capacitive
    sensor. This diaphragm responds to sound waves, with changes in an electric
    field replacing changes in air pressure. The Eko Core enables wireless
    transmission of heart sounds to a smartphone or tablet.

    https://insidefirstaid.com/diagnosis/the-best-littman-stethoscope-master-cardiology-and-classic-comparison
    Bells work similarly to diaphragms, but the hollow cavity in a bell has no
    membrane across it. Traditionally bells are used to listen to low frequency
    sounds.

    Although many stethoscopes come with a bell, there is disagreement in the
    medical community whether bells are useful or obsolete. Bells are traditionally
    thought to be better for hearing low-frequency sounds like some heart murmurs
    and bowel sounds while diaphragms are better for high frequency murmurs and
    lung sounds

    Thinklabs One solves auscultation via PPE. See Johns Hopkins preparation for COVID-19.

---Thinklabs and Covid 19-------------------------------------------------------

    https://www.thinklabs.com/covid19
    https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-containment-dr-jon-lapook-60-minutes-2020-03-08/
    https://www.thinklabs.com/infectious-disease-and-biocontainment

    Biocontainment presents a unique challenge for auscultation. With the Centers
    for Disease Control calling for personal protective equipment (PPE) in treating
    patients for the coronavirus, how does the clinician place stethoscope eartips
    in the ears for listening? Auscultation at the bedside using a conventional
    style stethoscope with tubing becomes impossible.

    Thinklabs One's unique stethoscope design allows healthcare workers to perform
    ausculation while being protected in an isolation environment, and can be
    used with protective covers in the ED to reduce contamination when pre-screening
    admissions.

    The One can be used directly using earbuds or headphones, via bluetooth
    transmitters within the isolation room or to a consultant outside the room,
    connected to a loudspeaker, or send sounds via email or instant messaging on
    iPhone or iPad.

    PPE
    -Personnel are donning disposable earbud headphones inside PPE or headsets
     over PPE.
    -If inside, the earbud/headphone cable is then snaked out of the protective
     clothing, to be connected, external to the clothing, to the Thinklabs One
     Digital Stethoscope. The clinician can then listen clearly to patient sounds
     while being fully suited up.  (LBC notes...Ugh...  Really?  A bluetooth radio
     chip costs like $1.00 in production. Opinion: any manufacturer of anything
     with electrons, who doesn't include a bluetooth or wifi chip these days is
     dumb, if not just purely for marketing buzz and hype.)

    Ziploc Protection for Primary Care and ED
    -One group of researchers developed a simple and practical way to treat multiple
     infectious patients using resealable Ziploc plastic bags. They connected the
     stethoscope to a Bluetooth transmitter and then placed the device inside of
     up to ten-yes, ten-resealable Ziploc plastic bags. The bags were sequentially
     removed to reveal a clean surface for listening to patients.

    -The Ziploc method is a novel way to take advantage of the Thinklabs One form
     factor. The entire stethoscope and Bluetooth transmitter fit inside a sealed
     bag.

    -This is ideal for ED and primary care use, where protection is highly
     desirable, but PPE impractical.

    terms:
    ausculation - the action of listening to sounds from the heart, lungs, or
    other organs, typically with a stethoscope, as a part of medical diagnosis.

    The idea for this product is to make a stethoscope easy to use in order to be used in hospitals and residences.
    (LBC note.  I sent a note to Adriano thru grabcad, asking for input, perhaps get him to join team. 3/29/2020, 4:30PM PST)

---Idea-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ESP32 devices have multiple wireless Inputs/output systems.  We could use
    bluetooth for heart/lungs audio, and use an other channel for battery life
    monitoring (I'm thinking a hospital has 20 of these things.. How many have low
    batteries?)  LoRa band can easily handle that little bit of IoT (internet of things)
    traffic, reminding hospital folks that units 1, 9 and 13 are running low and need
    to be charged...
