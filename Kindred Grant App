We are working on a stethoscope project that was initially started by This is a project initiated by Dr. Brian Lichtenstein on HelpWithCovid.com. Dr. Lichtenstein is a frontline physician in San Diego, and put out a request for a very affordable wireless stethoscope that could be made readily available for healthcare providers (HCP) during this pandemic. Desired features included Bluetooth capabilities to reduce very-close proximity exposure of HCP to patients with Covid-19, wide availability of the design, and a higher quality construction and sound than the low-cost stethoscopes widely in use.

PROBLEM:
Dr. Lichtenstein says that stethoscopes bring a healthcare provider (HCP) dangerously close to a person incubating covid-19. And one stethoscope is used by multiple HCP's throughout the day creating the risk of cross-contamination. The stethoscopes that are available to HCP's are either cheap, producing poor sound quality, or very expensive with better sound quality. When a HCP wears personal protective equipment (PPE), using a stethoscope can get complicated. In addition, sterilization can become difficult.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Our current base design is a stethoscope that can effectively listen to either heart beats or breathing sounds (20 Hz to 2 kHz), amplify the sound which is then played through a speaker. Our initially design is for an assembly that could be housed within a puck enclosure. This device will not feature tubes, binaurals and ear tips like traditional stethoscopes.

We are simultaneously looking into the inclusion of Bluetooth. The devices that we are aware of are neither natively Bluetooth or require an intermediary device i.e. smart phone used in listening. Dr. Lichtenstein ultimately desires a native Bluetooth device that any Bluetooth earplugs can connect with. The Bluetooth improvement can reduce the difficulty in listening to a patient's heart rate and/or breathing while fully dressed in PPE.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
Open-source design using parts that are readily available for purchase.
A stethoscope that provides high quality sound for any HCP that needs to listen to a patient.
Simple to use with lower exposure risk of covid-19 for HCP's.
Easy and safe to sterilize/sanitize.
Affordable to institutions and HCP's.
Donating 90% of proceeds to medical relief organizations.

OPEN LICENSING
Open source for hobbyist version.

As for the production version, we are unsure and not there yet.

TIMELINE
An estimate might be a month's time. We are currently in the prototyping stages in trying to develop a feasible device and test whether it meets our requirements.

Once we finalize which parts meets our requirements, we'll move forward with development devices so they could be tested by medical professionals in real settings for feedback. After refining the device based on feedback, we will develop multiple base units fulfilling a major milestone.

From here, we may seek to further refine the device particularly adding Bluetooth functionality and etc.

REQUESTED AMOUNT:
USD $5,000

Comment:
Mike Vang's comment: Reward is between USD $3,000 to USD $5,000.

PURPOSE OF FUNDS:
The grant will be used to purchase parts, supplies and etc. to help us prototype the design and then test the fidelity of the sound produced. The final open source design will be solicited online.

We may also seek to produce a production model design for mass production.

OBSERVATIONS:
Dr. Lichtenstein noted that many generic stethoscopes are poor quality. Higher grade stethoscopes are very expensive (USD $500+). Many stethoscopes do not feature Bluetooth.

By creating an affordable stethoscope, many HCP can own their own. 

And since the design includes a speaker, an HCP does not need to get closer to a patient that is incubating covid-19 or other infectious disease.
