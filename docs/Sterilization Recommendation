Chemicals:
  Ethylene Oxide
    a.k.a. EtO or EO

    Here is a link about electronic sterilization using EtO/EO or ethylene oxide: https://www.steris-ast.com/techtip/considerations-eo-processing-devices-containing-electronic-components/
    It has a checklist that determines if a device should or should not go through EO sterilization.

  EtO gas presents the danger of ignition. Probably a no-go.


  Hydrogen peroxide
 
  Peracetic acid
  
  Quaternary ammonium
  
  Citric Acid
  
  Ethanol
  
  Ethyl Alcohol
  
  Glycolic acid	
  
  Hydrocloric Acid
  
 
### Methods ###
Chemical

Gamma and E-Beam

Reusable devices that are sterilized using gamma or e-beam radiation methods must perform "quarterly dose audits" on devices.
These audits ensure that the reusable devices meet established standards and sterilization.
