Chemicals:
  Ethylene Oxide
    a.k.a. EtO or EO

    Here is a link about electronic sterilization using EtO/EO or ethylene oxide: https://www.steris-ast.com/techtip/considerations-eo-processing-devices-containing-electronic-components/
    It has a checklist that determines if a device should or should not go through EO sterilization.

  EtO gas presents the danger of ignition. Probably a no-go.


  Hydrogen peroxide
 
  Peracetic acid
  
  Quaternary ammonium
  
  Citric Acid
  
  Ethanol
  
  Ethyl Alcohol
  
  Glycolic acid	
  
  Hydrocloric Acid
  
 
### Methods ###
Electronics
For electronics such as cell phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, and keyboards, remove 
visible contamination if present.

Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.

Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics.

If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing 
at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.
