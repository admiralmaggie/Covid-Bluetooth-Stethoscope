    I really, really like Scheme-it for schematics.

    https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/design-tools/schemeit
    Way easy to share electronic design schematics.  Here is a recent project, that I
     started for a recent Hackathon challenge.

     Digikey saves everything the cloud for you, makes it way easy.
     Would we consider using such a tool. allows multiple folks to make changes...

---drawing tools----------------------------------------------------------------

    To draw simple boxes, use "Diagram Symbols" --> "Basic Shapes"
    To draw simple text labels, use "Diagram Symbols" --> "Basic Shapes"
    To add a full featured Text Box, use Top "Main" Tab, then select "Insert" --> "TextBox"
    To add wiring touch points, use... "Schematic Symbols"--> "Ports"

    Ground symbol?
    Schematic Symbols --> Ports

    Left hand menu selection disappeared?  Make sure you clear the search..

    How do you rename elements?  Ans:  Highlight the element, you will see a
    yellow circle.  click on that. Notice the info on the right margin.  Only items
    clicked will be displayed.

---Object labeling--------------------------------------------------------------

    On the right hand margin of Scheme-it, there is a right pull out arrow.  This
    is the object properties viewer.  For any individual object selected on the
    screen, there are properties.  The properties with check mark are displayed
    on screen. If you want to hide a property "Mik18", click the check box off.
    You can also insert custom titles from there.

---Large Dev kit boards?--------------------------------------------------------

    What's the best way to identify pinouts for large dev kit boards,
    e.g. ESP32, Raspberry Pi, etc...

    Best way is to find a pinout image on the internet.  Save that.  Open up
    your favorite image program, and carefully crop the image to just beyond
    the board boundaries.  Import that image into the scheme-it screen from the
    top menu, towards the right, "Insert --> Image".

    Scale the image up or down until it makes sense.  Be careful with the scaling,
    the corner selects do NOT lock image aspect ratio, sigh. Try to get the pins to
    line up with the grid lines as best you can.

    You have to do one more trick to make that work.  You have to all little
    wire connector tic marks to each pin location.  Those tic marks are located
    on the left hand menu Custom Symbols --> Symbol Primitives --> Pin Right or
    pin left or pin top or pin bottom.  Drag and drop the little tick mark pin
    to the right location on the edge of your image.  After you place the pins
    its easy to do the wire routing.  Note the wire will only make a connection
    to one side of the pin, that's why pin left vs pin right matters.
