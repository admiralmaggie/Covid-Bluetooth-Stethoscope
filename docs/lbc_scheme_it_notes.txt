    I really, really like Scheme-it for schematics.

    https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/design-tools/schemeit
    Way easy to share electronic design schematics.  Here is a recent project, that I
     started for a recent Hackathon challenge.

    How do you rename elements?  Ans:  Highlight the element, you will see a
    yellow circle.  click on that. Notice the info on the right margin.  Only items
    clicked will be displayed.
