## Organizational agreement

The agreement is that Ctrl-h will become an informal fiscal sponsor of the Covid-19 Bluetooth Stethoscope Project under their 501(c)(3) non-profit status.

The Covid-19 Bluetooth Stethoscope Project will become an official project of Ctrl-h.  Ctrl-h will hold the current funds allocated to the Stethoscope project, to be transferred over, and those funds will only be allocated for stethoscope project costs.  For disbursement, Stethoscope project coordinators will create and approve invoices that can be fulfilled by Ctrl-h administration.

Ctrl-h has agreed to this arrangement for one year free-of-charge, after which we will revert to a 5% administration fee, capped at 5% of current assets.  Over time as plans develop, if desired the Stethoscope project can organize as it's own non-profit corporation and we can move towards an official fiscal sponsorship arrangement registered with the state of Oregon.

The current grant agreement with Protocol Labs specifies:

 1. At all times, Grantee will act lawfully and comply with any and all laws and/or rules applicable to its activities, including tax, ethics, or campaign finance laws.

2. To the extent the Project involves developing software, you agree that any software developed using the Contribution will be licensed under an Open Source Initiative-approved open source license.

3. Grantee will not use these funds to make campaign contributions to candidates or political committees, or engage in political campaign intervention or political activities of any kind.

4. Grantee agrees to indemnify Protocol Labs from any and all claims, damages, fines or liabilities that result from Granteeâ€™s activities.

5. Although we do not require a report detailing how funds were used, we appreciate regular and timely updates.

6. This letter pertains only to the Contribution identified in this letter and should not be construed as a commitment or pledge, either explicit or implied, of any future contributions to Grantee. It is expressly understood by the parties that this letter relates to a contribution and is not a contract between the parties for services or guaranteed payment. Accordingly, Protocol Labs may, in its sole discretion, postpone or cancel any installment payment, or all future installment payments, contemplated under this agreement.

Though stipulation #2 specifies software, regarding hardware, any designs the Project produce will be provided to the public under an open-source license.

The current project coordinators are:

Dr. Brian L\
Charley L\
L.B. C\
Aaron R\
Michael V

(Full contact information is provided in the Google spreadsheet)

My suggestion is that for the time being, invoice disbursements be approved by any three project coordinators.\
