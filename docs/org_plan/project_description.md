# Project description:  low-cost open-source DIY wireless stethoscope designs

(from [https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/252-bluetooth-stethoscope-pulse-oximeter](https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/252-bluetooth-stethoscope-pulse-oximeter))

This is a collaborative volunteer driven project to develop designs for low-cost wireless stethoscopes that can be constructed with hobbyist-level skill and tools and provided to medical professionals using the same volunteer-driven model current being used to create and donate face shield and masks world-wide.


## The problem

High-quality stethoscopes are expensive, and stethoscopes in general are hard to sterilize.  This results in a use model where cheap stethoscopes are acquired by the hospital/clinic and one is assigned to each patient, with every professional who works with that patient using the same stethoscope.  This can result in cross-contamination as someone touches many stethoscopes.  Cheap stethoscopes also wear out quickly and have short hoses, resulting in professionals getting physically closer to the patient than necessary, particularly if they have to put their arm around the patient and listen to positions on the back.

With Covid-19 this is an even greater problem because medical professionals may be wearing full PPE and struggle to get a traditional stethoscope into their ears safely.

Like N95 masks and face shields, there is concern that stethoscopes may become a scarce commodity as the pandemic continues to spread, and poorer countries with weaker healthcare systems will particularly struggle to source in-demand equipment.


## Our goal

To create stethoscope designs that reduce the risk of infection during use and cost of manufacture, and that can be built and validated by enthusiasts or manufacturers around the world, at price points that are viable in a variety of markets.

Current digital stethoscopes on the market start at $300-$500, and can go as high as $2700/unit. We are working towards the units being effectively disposable, to the point where if a hospital *had* to assign one to each patient and then throw it away when done it wouldnâ€™t be a financial hardship.

In designing several different models we are targeting different price points and are able to deliver the simplest design fast.


## Our solutions

In order to reduce close physical contact between patient and medical professional we need an electronic device which can amplify or transmit the internal sounds created by the heart and lungs. Our lowest-tech concept design is a single hand-held device which picks up the sounds with a microphone and amplifies it to a speaker. More advanced designs will transmit that sound via Bluetooth to an over-the-ear headset worn by the medical professional. Our goal is to have the units be easily disinfected between uses so they can be utilized on multiple patients, but cheap enough that if necessary they could be assigned to a single patient as is the case with current stethoscopes.

This project is developing rapidly and constantly evolving. We are starting the simple amplifier + speaker and Bluetooth designs in parallel with the plan that learnings from one design can be applied to others. All designs are intended to be constructed by anyone with some basic electronics knowledge and a soldering iron, and possibly access to a 3D printer.


### However...

However, we are not inherently attached to these solutions, and encourage additional designs which will meet our device requirements with as much off-the-shelf tech as possible.  We continue to look at alternate solutions (such as repurposing cheap earpods) to see if we can create better, cheaper, or more "quick-and-dirty" designs.
