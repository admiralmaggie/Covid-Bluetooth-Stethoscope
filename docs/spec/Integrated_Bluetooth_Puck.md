# Concept

This builds on the other two solution concepts ('Quick-and-dirty' Analog microphone to speaker solution and Integrated speaker and puck with digital signal processing) with added bluetooth capability. 
Stethescope puck will have a microphone and ESP32 module which should be able to pair with bluetooth earphones.


## Specifications
- Multiple different hospital staff need to be able to use the stethescope device. All share same earphones? Make device able to pair with different headphones?
