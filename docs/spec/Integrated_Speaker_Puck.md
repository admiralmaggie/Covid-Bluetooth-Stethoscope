## Concept

This is an open source hardware project.  

Our initial concept is a battery powered electric stethoscope with integral speaker that will:
- Aid the medical care worker in a hospital environment, while wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE).
- Enable the medical care worker to perform all tasks normally done by a hose type stethoscope with complete audio function
- Enable the medical care worker to avoid the time and overhead of disenfecting a stethoscope between patients.
- Enable the medical care worker to avoid the interference between inserting stethoscope hose into their ears while wearing PPE.
- Be built for minimal costs using existing components publicly available.
- Be built by a home hobbyist with access to a 3D printer and basic electronic tools (hand tools, soldering iron)
- Will fit into a Ziploc sandwich bag (as a protective measure, for disinfectant issues)

If demand grows immensely, then manufactured electronic boards with integral surface mount components would be considered.

Additionally if demand for this product grows, we would consider investing in injection molding dies for production level run to manufacture housings.

###Specification

- Audio performance for listening to heart and lungs with our electronic stethoscope speaker system must match or exceed the perceived audio clarity of using an a purchased high quality stethoscope.
- The device must have intuitive controls.
- The device must fit and function inside a Ziploc sandwich bag, including functionality of all controls (volume and power on/off)
- The device should be fully functional by a health care worker while wearing protective rubber gloves.
